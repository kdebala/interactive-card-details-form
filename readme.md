## Overview

### The challenge

#### Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details updated
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:

  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format

- If there are no errors, display the completed state
- Reset the form when the user clicks "Continue" on the completed state
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

### What I learned

This challenge was a really great learning opportunity, it was also very useful to reinforce previous knowledge and face problems that had not been presented to me before.This challenge is very good to practise CSS and Javascript.

### Continued development

I plan on taking up challenges that requires more Javascript writing to practise.
